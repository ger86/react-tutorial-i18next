# üîÅ React & i18next

## Description

In this project I want to show you how we can integrate the **i18next** library with React thanks to **react-i18next** to add translations to our application.

The library `react-i18next` also has its own hooks (`useTranslation`), something that comes as an addition now that functional components are the trend in development with React.

## You will learn

Integrating **i18next** in a project developed with React thanks to **react-i18next** library.

Using the hook `useTranslation` to translate texts.

Implementing a language switcher thanks to `i18next` object. 

Asynchronously loading the translation files, separating them in different files.

## Run the project

Use `yarn start` to run the app in the development mode and open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
